 open source autonomic platform to be tracking the performance by harnessing big data comprised of HW and mostly SW issues in DC/Cloud infra 
As you know that Data centers are made up of multiple hardware and software layers, including networks, servers, storage, hypervisors, operating systems, and applications. Within each layer, there can be multiple individual components from multiple vendors. Although all the components should be designed to work together, there is an enormous amount of complexity caused by the sheer volume of components and interactions that take place between them. Therefore, tracking the performance by harnessing big data comprised of HW and mostly SW issues is the very heart of a matter.
Since I have lots of experiences in problematic area [ https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141130102143-376372618-intelligent-data-center-operations-management ], I have an use case developing a simple prototype will be carried out through open platforms such OpenStack + Open Compute Project (OCP) + Linked Open Data cloud (LOD) using some open platforms (there are lots of initiatives to be provided knowledge grahp DB, OASIS-OSLC, KBpedia, GraphDB, eCloudManager etc). The main motivation is to make influence on efficiency of all the components within the data center ecosystem and demonstrate how it can lead to optimized energy consumption as well as material use by delivering autonomous monitoring and management via autonomic computing implementation. 
So I'd like to design and develop an open source autonomic platform to be tracking the performance by harnessing big data comprised of HW and mostly SW issues in DC/Cloud infra with the predictive analytics capability shall be included the intimate knowledge of and the ability to collect information across the infrastructure stack (all layers and components) by using semantic technologies and its standards combination with machine learning.
